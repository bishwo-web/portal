James Buchanan "Bucky" Barnes, played by Sebastian Stan, is Captain America’s best friend who transforms into the deadly assassin known as the Winter Soldier before ultimately redeeming himself.  

#### **Key Moments in the MCU:**  

- **Pre-War & WWII – *Captain America: The First Avenger* (2011):**

- **Hydra's Experiment & Brainwashing – *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* (2014):**  
  He is revealed to have survived due to Hydra’s experiments and has been brainwashed into the Winter Soldier. He becomes a feared assassin, working for Hydra for decades in a cryogenically frozen state between missions. After a battle with Steve, his memories start returning, and he vanishes.  

- **Self-Discovery & Civil War – *Captain America: Civil War* (2016):**  
  Bucky is framed for the bombing of the UN and hunted by authorities. Steve protects him, leading to the Avengers' split. It is revealed that Hydra forced him to kill Tony Stark’s parents. At the end, he chooses to go into cryogenic sleep in Wakanda to remove his brainwashing.  

- **Redemption & Endgame – *Black Panther* (2018) & *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018):**  
  Now called the "White Wolf" by Wakandans, Bucky is cured of Hydra’s control. He fights alongside the Avengers but is dusted by Thanos’ snap. In *Endgame*, he returns for the final battle.  

- **Taking the Next Step – *The Falcon and the Winter Soldier* (2021 series):**  
  He struggles with guilt over his past as an assassin and tries to make amends. He works alongside Sam Wilson and ultimately supports him in taking on the mantle of Captain America.
